# Make this a markdown file and clean it up.

Make an Arch Linux package that installs the AMD Pro renderer for Blender.

The dependencies appear to be

- opencl-amd or the pro AMD driver - Attempt to support both with precedence for the open version (what I'm using on my Vega)
- dpkg (or I might have to update the embedded python script)
- python3
- blender (initially support the non AUR one only until it's working then investigate Git version)


Initial looking around

# Make the run file executable (It's made with something called makeself)
chmod +x ./radeonprorenderforblender.run

# Extract the embedded contents and move and git init
./radeonprorenderforblender.run --target /tmp/radeonprorenderforblender

Understand how it detects the OS version and add support for Arch and use pacman rather than dpkg
Get it working (also for uninstall) and create an AUR package + submit the change to AMD to add official support for Arch.

It also asks where Blender is installed and that the Eula is read. Detect the location automatically and automatically accept the Euala (perhaps ...)

Also detect the version of the renderer and Blender and report to the user.
